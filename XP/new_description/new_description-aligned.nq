The curriculum emphasizes designing scalable and secure architectures, version control using GIT, API integration, responsive design, performance optimization, and security best practices. Testing, debugging, accessibility, deployment, and staying updated with industry trends are also highlighted. The course includes practical small-scale testing, test-driven development, and documentation practices. Software design principles such as separation of concerns, information hiding, coupling, and cohesion are covered, along with software architecture paradigms like client-server and microservice architectures. Students learn about programming in the large, code smells, and software configuration management using version control. Additional topics include shell scripting for system task automation and text processing, object-oriented programming concepts, and SQL query formation.</page1>\n        <page2>Page : 241 CS Core : None, KA Core : 5 (+1) (Additional hours here are hours\nshared with other Areas) KA Core: 1\\.

It is imperative to recognize that this is not a one-way\nstreet. Society also affects computing, resulting in a complex socio-technical\ncontext that is constantly changing, requiring the perspective of history to\nput the present as well as the possible future into appropriate perspective.\nSocial Context provides the foundation for all other knowledge units in SEP,\nparticularly Professional Ethics.

It aims to equip students with the skills to create short animations using key animation principles. The course covers essential topics in computer animation, including the principles of animation, techniques for creating motion, and the use of animation software. Additionally, the course explores privacy and civil liberties, focusing on the implications of data collection, surveillance, and emerging technologies. Students will learn about anonymity, pseudonymity, and identity, as well as technological solutions for privacy protection, such as end-to-end encryption and differential privacy. The course also examines civil liberties, privacy rights, and cultural differences in the context of privacy. By the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of both animation techniques and the critical aspects of privacy in the digital age." <http://faiss.org/5075cd35a4a7d349da34685a87c0ec83ecfcedaaf3032c7d3c495b81a6cfc4d6> .

Additionally, the course explores privacy and civil liberties, focusing on the implications of data collection, surveillance, and emerging technologies. Students will learn about anonymity, pseudonymity, and identity, as well as technological solutions for privacy protection, such as end-to-end encryption and differential privacy. The course also examines civil liberties, privacy rights, and cultural differences in the context of privacy. By the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of both animation techniques and the critical aspects of privacy in the digital age.</page1>\n        <page2>Pages : 216-217 CS Core : 2, KA Core : 1 Electronic information sharing\nhighlights the need to balance privacy protections with information access.\nThe ease of digital access to many types of data - in addition to copying and\ndistributing these data - makes privacy rights and civil liberties more\ncomplex, especially given cultural and legal differences in these areas.\nComplicating matters further, privacy also has interpersonal, organizational,\nprofessional/business, and governance components. In addition, the\ninterconnected nature of online communities raises challenges for managing\nexpectations and protections for freedom of expression invarious cultures and\nnations. Technology companies that provide platforms for user-generated\ncontent are under increasing pressure to perform governance tasks, potentially\nfacing liability for their decisions. CS Core: 1\\.

It also\ninforms decisions based on successes and failures of the past including harm\ndone and how to not repeat them. The history of computing is often taught in\ncontext with foundational concepts, such as system fundamentals and software\ndevelopment fundamentals. A focus should be placed on those who, due to\nmarginalization, have not historically featured as prominently as they should.\nCS Core: 1\\.

Always respond only with a valid JSON-LD object, without explanation or formatting.\n\n        The following describes the content of a lecture and a Knowledge Unit (KU) in Computer Science.\n\n        <page1>Course name: Introduction to Programming with Digital MediaObjective: N/ACourse content: This course introduces foundational programming concepts with a focus on digital media. Students learn to explain, evaluate, and apply algorithms and arrays in digital media contexts. The curriculum covers foundational data structures, graphic output devices, human vision principles, image formats, digitization, color models, and animation. It also explores programming concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, functions, and error handling. Additionally, the course touches on user-centered design, ethics, and professional practices in programming.</page1>\n        <page2>Pages: 131-132-133 HOURS CS Core = 4 KA Core = 3 FPL-Functional: Functional\nProgramming CS Core: 1\\. Lambda expressions and evaluation: (See also: AL-\nModels, FPL-Formalism) a. Variable binding and scope rules. (See also: SDF-\nFundamentals) b. Parameter-passing. (See also: SDF-Fundamentals) c. Nested\nlambda expressions and reduction order. 2\\. Effect-free programming: a.\nFunction calls have no side effects, facilitating compositional reasoning. b.\nImmutable variables and data copying vs reduction. c. Use of recursion vs\nloops vs pipelining (map/reduce). 3\\. Processing structured data (e.g., trees)\nvia functions with cases for each data variant: a. Functions defined over\ncompound data in terms of functions applied to the constituent pieces. b.\nPersistent data structures. 4\\. Using higher-order functions (taking,\nreturning, and storing functions). KA Core: 5\\. Metaprogramming and\nreflection. 6\\. Function closures (functions using variables in the enclosing\nlexical environment). a. Basic meaning and definition - creating closures at\nrun-time by capturing the environment. b. Canonical idioms: call-backs,\narguments to iterators, reusable code via function arguments. c. Using a\nclosure to encapsulate data in its environment. d. Delayed versus eager\nevaluation. Non-core: 7\\. Graph reduction machine and call-by-need. 8\\.\nImplementing delayed evaluation. 9\\. Integration with logic programming\nparadigm using concepts such as equational logic, narrowing, residuation and\nsemantic unification. (See also: FPL-Logic) 10\\. Integration with other\nprogramming paradigms such as imperative and object-oriented. Illustrative\nlearning outcomes: CS Core: 1\\. Develop basic algorithms that avoid assigning\nto mutable states or considering reference equality. 2\\. Develop useful\nfunctions that take and return other functions. 3\\. Compare and contrast how\ncomputational solutions to a problem differ in procedural, functional, and\nobject-oriented approaches. 4\\. Compare and contrast mechanisms to define and\nprotect data elements within procedural, functional, and object-oriented\napproaches. KA Core: 5\\. Explain a simple example of lambda expression being\nimplemented using a virtual machine, such as a SECD machine, showing storage\nand reclaim of the environment. 6\\. Correctly interpret variables and lexical\nscope in a program using function closures. 7\\. Use functional encapsulation\nmechanisms such as closures and modular interfaces. 8\\. Compare and contrast\nstateful vs stateless execution. 9\\. Define and use iterators and other\noperations on aggregates, including operations that take functions as\narguments, in multiple programming languages, selecting the most natural\nidioms for each language. (See also: FPL-OOP) Non-core: 10\\. Illustrate graph\nreduction using a l-expression using a shared subexpression. 11\\. Illustrate\nthe execution of a simple nested l-expression using an abstract machine, such\nas an ABC machine. 12\\. Illustrate narrowing, residuation, and semantic\nunification using simple illustrative examples. 13\\. Illustrate the\nconcurrency constructs using simple programming examples of known concepts\nsuch as a buffer being read and written concurrently or sequentially.
