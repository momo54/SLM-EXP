Title: PDC-Algorithms: Algorithms

KA Core:
3. One of more of the following algorithmic domains. (See also: AL-Strategies):
a. Linear algebra: Vector and matrix operations, numerical precision/stability, applications in
data analytics and machine learning.
b. Data processing: sorting, searching and retrieval, concurrent data structures.
c. Graphs, search, and combinatorics: Marking, edge-parallelization, bounding, speculation,
network-based analytics.
d. Modeling and simulation: differential equations; randomization, N-body problems, genetic
algorithms.
e. Computational logic: satisfiability (SAT), concurrent logic programming.
f. Graphics and computational geometry: Transforms, rendering, ray-tracing.
g. Resource management: Allocating, placing, recycling and scheduling processors, memory,
channels, and hosts; exclusive vs shared resources; static, dynamic and elastic algorithms;
Real-time constraints; Batching, prioritization, partitioning; decentralization via work-stealing
and related techniques.
h. Services: Implementing web APIs, electronic currency, transaction systems, multiplayer
games.
