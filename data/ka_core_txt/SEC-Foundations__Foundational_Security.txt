Title: SEC-Foundations: Foundational Security

KA Core:
8. Access control models (e.g., discretionary, mandatory, role-based, and attribute-based)
9. Security controls
10. Concepts of trust and trustworthiness
11. Applications of a security mindset: web, cloud, and mobile devices (See also: SF-System Design,
SPD-Common)
12. Protecting embedded and cyber-physical systems (See also: SPD-Embedded)
13. Principles of usable security and human-centered computing (See also: HCI-Design, SEP-Security)
14. Security and trust in AI/machine learning systems, e.g., fit for purpose, ethical operating
boundaries, authoritative knowledge sources, verified training data, repeatable system evaluation
tests, system attestation, independent validation/certification; unintended consequences from:
adverse effect (See also: AI-Introduction, AI-ML, AI-SEP, SEP-Security)
15. Security risks in building and operating AI/machine learning systems (e.g., algorithm bias,
knowledge corpus bias, training corpus bias, copyright violation) (See also: AI-Introduction, AI-ML,
AI-SEP)
16. Hardware considerations in security, e.g., principles of secure hardware, secure processor
architectures, cryptographic acceleration, compartmentalization, software-hardware interaction (See
also: AR-Assembly, AR-Representation, OS-Purpose)
