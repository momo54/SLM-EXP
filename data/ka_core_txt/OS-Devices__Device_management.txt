Title: OS-Devices: Device management

KA Core:
1. Buffering strategies (See also: AR-IO)
2. Direct Memory Access (DMA) and polled I/O, Memory-mapped I/O (See also: AR-IO)
Example concept: DMA communication protocols (e.g., ring buffers etc.)
3. Historical and contextual - Persistent storage device management (e.g., magnetic, Solid State
Device (SSD)) (See also: SEP-History)
Non-Core:
4. Device interface abstractions, hardware abstraction layer
5. Device driver purpose, abstraction, implementation, and testing challenges
6. High-level fault tolerance in device communication
