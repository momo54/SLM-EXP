Title: MSF-Calculus

KA Core:
1. Sequences, series, limits
192
2. Single-variable derivatives: definition, computation rules (chain rule etc.), derivatives of important
functions, applications
3. Single-variable integration: definition, computation rules, integrals of important functions,
fundamental theorem of calculus, definite vs indefinite, applications (including in probability)
4. Parametric and polar representations
5. Taylor series
6. Multivariate calculus: partial derivatives, gradient, chain-rule, vector valued functions,
7. Optimization: convexity, global vs local minima, gradient descent, constrained optimization, and
Lagrange multipliers.
8. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs): definition, Euler method, applications to simulation, Monte
Carlo integration
9. CS applications: gradient descent for machine learning, forward and inverse kinematics,
applications of calculus to probability
Note: the calculus topics listed above are aligned with computer science goals rather than with
traditional calculus courses. For example, multivariate calculus is often a course by itself, but computer
science undergraduates only need parts of it for machine learning.
