Title: PDC-Coordination: Coordination

KA Core:
4. One or more of the following properties and extensions
a. Progress properties including lock-free, wait-free, fairness, priority scheduling, interactions
with consistency, reliability
b. Performance with respect to contention, granularity, convoying, scaling
c. Non-blocking data structures and algorithms
d. Ownership and resource control
e. Lock variants and alternatives: sequence locks, read-write locks; Read-Copy-Update (RCU),
reentrancy; tickets; controlling spinning versus blocking
f. Transaction-based control: Optimistic and conservative
g. Distributed locking: reliability
h. Alternatives to barriers: Clocks; counters, virtual clocks; dataflow and continuations; futures
and RPC; consensus-based, gathering results with reducers and collectors
i. Speculation, selection, cancellation; observability and security consequences
j. Resource control using semaphores and condition variables
k. Control flow: Scheduling computations, series-parallel loops with (possibly elected) leaders,
pipelines and streams, nested parallelism
l. Exceptions and failures. Handlers, detection, timeouts, fault tolerance, voting
