Title: AR-Performance-Energy: Performance and Energy Efficiency

KA Core:
1. Performance-energy evaluation (introduction): performance, power consumption, memory, and
communication costs (See also: SF-Evaluation, OS-Scheduling, SPD-Game)
2. Branch prediction, speculative execution, out-of-order execution, Tomasulo's algorithm
3. Enhancements for vector processors and GPUs (See also: SPD-Game)
4. Hardware support for multithreading (See also: OS-Concurrency, OS-Scheduling, PDC-Programs)
a. Race conditions
b. Lock implementations
c. Point-to-point synchronization
d. Barrier implementation
5. Scalability
6. Alternative architectures including VLIW/EPIC, accelerators, and other special purpose processors
7. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)
8. Dark Silicon
