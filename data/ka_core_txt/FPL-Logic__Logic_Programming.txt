Title: FPL-Logic: Logic Programming

KA Core:
1. Use a logic language to implement a conventional algorithm.
2. Use a logic language to implement an algorithm employing implicit search using clauses, relations,
and cuts.
3. Use a simple illustrative example to show correspondence between First Order Predicate Logic
(FOPL) and logic programs using Horn clauses.
4. Use examples to illustrate the unification algorithm and its role of parameter-passing in query
reduction.
5. Use simple logic programs interleaving relations, functions, and recursive programming such as
factorial and Fibonacci numbers and simple complex relationships between entities and illustrate
execution and parameter-passing using unification and backtracking.
