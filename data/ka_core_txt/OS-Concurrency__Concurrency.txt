Title: OS-Concurrency: Concurrency

KA Core:
6. Thread creation, states, structures (See also: SF-Foundations)
7. Thread APIs
8. Deadlocks and starvation (necessary conditions/mitigations) (See also: PDC-Coordination)
9. Implementing thread safe code (semaphores, mutex locks, condition variables). (See also: AR-
Performance-Energy, SF-Evaluation, PDC-Evaluation)
10. Race conditions in shared memory (See also: PDC-Coordination)
Non-Core:
11. Managing atomic access to OS objects (e.g., big kernel lock vs many small locks vs lockless data
structures like lists)
