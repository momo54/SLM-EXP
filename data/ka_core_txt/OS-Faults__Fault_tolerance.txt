Title: OS-Faults: Fault tolerance

KA Core:
1. Reliable and available systems. (See also: SF-Reliability)
2. Software and hardware approaches to address tolerance (RAID). (See also: SF-Reliability)
Non-Core:
3. Spatial and temporal redundancy. (See also: SF-Reliability)
4. Methods used to implement fault tolerance. (See also: SF-Reliability)
5. Error identification and correction mechanisms, checksums of volatile memory in RAM. (See also:
AR-Memory)
6. File system consistency check and recovery.
7. Journaling and log-structured file systems. (See also: SF-Reliability)
8. Use-cases for fault-tolerance (databases, safety-critical). (See also: SF-Reliability)
9. Examples of OS mechanisms for detection, recovery, restart to implement fault tolerance, use of
these techniques for the OSâ€™s own services. (See also: SF-Reliability)
