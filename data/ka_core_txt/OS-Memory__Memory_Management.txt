Title: OS-Memory: Memory Management

KA Core:
1. Review of physical memory, address translation and memory management hardware (See also:
AR-Memory, MSF-Discrete)
2. Impact of memory hierarchy including cache concept, cache lookup, and per-CPU caching on
operating system mechanisms and policy (See also: AR-Memory, SF-Performance)
210
3. Logical and physical addressing, address space virtualization (See also: AR-Memory, MSF-
Discrete)
4. Concepts of paging, page replacement, thrashing and allocation of pages and frames
5. Allocation/deallocation/storage techniques (algorithms and data structure) performance and
flexibility
Example concept: Arenas, slab allocators, free lists, size classes, heterogeneously sized pages
(huge pages)
6. Memory caching and cache coherence and the effect of flushing the cache to avoid speculative
execution vulnerabilities (See also: AR-Organization, AR-Memory, SF-Performance)
7. Security mechanisms and concepts in memory management including sandboxing, protection,
isolation, and relevant vectors of attack (See also: SEC-Foundations)
Non-Core:
8. Virtual memory: leveraging virtual memory hardware for OS services and efficiency
