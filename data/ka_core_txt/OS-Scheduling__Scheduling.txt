Title: OS-Scheduling: Scheduling

KA Core:
1. Preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling
2. Schedulers and policies (e.g., first come, first serve, shortest job first, priority, round robin,
multilevel) (See also: SF-Resource)
3. Concepts of Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP) scheduling and cache coherence (See also: AR-
Memory)
4. Timers (e.g., building many timers out of finite hardware timers) (See also: AR-Assembly)
5. Fairness and starvation
Non-Core:
6. Subtopics of operating systems such as energy-aware scheduling and real-time scheduling (See
also: AR-Performance-Energy, SPD-Embedded, SPD-Mobile)
7. Cooperative scheduling, such as Linux futexes and userland scheduling.
