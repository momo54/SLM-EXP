Title: FPL-Abstraction: Program Abstraction and Representation

KA Core:
1. Illustrate the scope of variables and visibility using simple programs.
2. Illustrate different types of parameter-passing using simple pseudo programming language.
3. Explain side-effect using global and nonlocal variables and how to fix such programs.
4. Explain how programs that process other programs treat the other programs as their input data.
5. Describe a grammar and an abstract syntax tree for a small language.
6. Describe the benefits of having program representations other than strings of source code.
7. Implement a program to process some representation of code for some purpose, such as an
interpreter, an expression optimizer, or a documentation generator.
