Title: SF-Performance: System Performance

CS Core:
1. Latencies in computer systems
a. Speed of light and computers (one foot per nanosecond vs one GHz clocks) (See also: AR-
Organization)
b. Memory vs disk latencies vs across-the-network memory (See also: AR-Memory, AR-
Performance-Energy)
2. Caches and the effects of spatial and temporal locality on performance in processors and systems
(See also: AR-Memory, AR-Performance-Energy, OS-Memory)
3. Caches and cache coherency in databases, operating systems, distributed systems, and computer
architecture (See also: OS-Memory, AR-Memory, DM-Internals)
4. Introduction to the processor memory hierarchy (See also: AR-Memory, AR-Performance-Energy)
