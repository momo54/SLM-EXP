Title: AI-Search: Search

CS Core:
1. State space representation of a problem
a. Specifying states, goals, and operators
b. Factoring states into representations (hypothesis spaces)
c. Problem solving by graph search
i. e.g., Graphs as a space, and tree traversals as exploration of that space
ii. Dynamic construction of the graph (not given upfront)
2. Uninformed graph search for problem solving (See also: AL-Foundational)
a. Breadth-first search
b. Depth-first search
i. With iterative deepening
c. Uniform cost search
3. Heuristic graph search for problem solving (See also: AL-Strategies)
a. Heuristic construction and admissibility
b. Hill-climbing
c. Local minima and the search landscape
i. Local vs global solutions
d. Greedy best-first search
e. A* search
