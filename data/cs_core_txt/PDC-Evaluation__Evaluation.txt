Title: PDC-Evaluation: Evaluation

CS Core:
1. Safety and liveness requirements in terms of temporal logic constructs to express “always” and
“eventually” (See also: FPL-Parallel)
2. Identifying, testing for, and repairing violations, including common forms of errors such as failure to
ensure necessary ordering (race errors), atomicity (including check-then-act errors), and
termination (livelock)
3. Performance requirements metrics for throughput, responsiveness, latency, availability, energy
consumption, scalability, resource usage, communication costs, waiting and rate control, fairness;
service level agreements (See also: SF-Performance)
4. Performance impact of design and implementation choices, including granularity, overhead,
consensus costs, and energy consumption (See also: SEP-Sustainability)
5. Estimating scalability limitations, for example using Amdahl’s Law or Universal Scalability Law (See
also: SF-Evaluation)
