CS Core:
1. Social implications (e.g., political and cultural ideologies) in a hyper-networked world where the
capabilities and impact of social media, artificial intelligence, and computing in general are rapidly

2. Impact of computing applications (e.g., social media, artificial intelligence applications) on individual
well-being, and safety of all kinds (e.g., physical, emotional, economic).
3. Consequences of involving computing technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, biometric
technologies, and algorithmic decision-making systems, in civic life (e.g., facial recognition
technology, biometric tags, resource distribution algorithms, policing software) and how human
agency and oversight is crucial.
