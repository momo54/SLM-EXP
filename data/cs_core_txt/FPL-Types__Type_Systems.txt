3. Describe examples of program errors detected by a type system.
4. Identify program properties, for multiple programming languages, that are checked statically and
program properties that are checked dynamically.
5. Describe an example program that does not type-check in a particular language and yet would have
no error if run.
6. Use types and type-error messages to write and debug programs.
