Title: SF-Foundations: Basic Concepts

CS Core:
1. Digital vs Analog/Discrete vs Continuous Systems
2. Simple logic gates, logical expressions, Boolean logic simplification
3. Clocks, State, Sequencing
4. State and state transition (e.g., starting state, final state, life cycle of states) (See also: AL-Models)
5. Finite state machines (e.g., NFA, DFA) (See also: AL-Models)
6. Combinational Logic, Sequential Logic, Registers, Memories (See also: AR-Logic)
7. Computers and Network Protocols as examples of State Machines (See also: NC-Fundamentals)
8. Sequential vs parallel processing. (See also: PDC-Programs, OS-Concurrency)
9. Application-level sequential processing: single thread (See also: PDC-Programs, OS-Concurrency)
10. Simple application-level parallel processing: request level (web services/client-server/distributed),
single thread per server, multiple threads with multiple servers, pipelining (See also: PDC-
Programs, OS-Concurrency)
