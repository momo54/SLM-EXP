Title: FPL-Functional: Functional Programming

CS Core:
1. Develop basic algorithms that avoid assigning to mutable states or considering reference equality.
2. Develop useful functions that take and return other functions.
3. Compare and contrast how computational solutions to a problem differ in procedural, functional,
and object-oriented approaches.
4. Compare and contrast mechanisms to define and protect data elements within procedural,
functional, and object-oriented approaches.
