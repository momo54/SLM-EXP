Title: FPL-Translation: Language Translation and Execution

CS Core:
1. Explain and understand the differences between compiled, JIT, and interpreted language
implementations, including the benefits and limitations of each.
2. Differentiate syntax and parsing from semantics and evaluation.

3. Use BNF and extended BNF to specify the syntax of simple constructs such as if-then-else, type
declaration and iterative constructs for known languages such as C++ or Python.
4. Illustrate the parse tree using a simple sentence/arithmetic expression.
5. Illustrate translation of syntax diagrams to BNF/extended BNF for simple constructs such as if-then-
else, type declaration, iterative constructs, etc.
6. Illustrate ambiguity in parsing using nested if-then-else/arithmetic expression and show resolution
using precedence order.
KA-Core:
7. Discuss the benefits and limitations of garbage collection, including the notion of reachability.
