Title: SEC-Crypto: Cryptography

CS Core:
1. Differences between algorithmic, applied, and mathematical views of cryptography
2. Mathematical preliminaries: modular arithmetic, Euclidean algorithm, probabilistic independence,
linear algebra basics, number theory, finite fields, complexity, asymptotic analysis (See also: MSF-
Discrete, MSF-Linear)
3. Basic cryptography: symmetric key and public key cryptography (See also: AL-Foundational, MSF-
Discrete)
4. Basic cryptographic building blocks, including symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption,
hashing, and message authentication (See also: MSF-Discrete)
5. Classical cryptosystems, such as shift, substitution, transposition ciphers, code books, and
machines (See also: MSF-Discrete)
6. Kerckhoffâ€™s principle and use of vetted libraries (See also: SE-Construction)
7. Usage of cryptography in real-world applications, e.g., electronic cash, secure channels between
clients and servers, secure electronic mail, entity authentication, device pairing, steganography, and
voting systems (See also: NC-Security, GIT-Image)
