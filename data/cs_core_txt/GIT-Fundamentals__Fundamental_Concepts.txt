Title: GIT-Fundamentals: Fundamental Concepts

CS Core:
1. Uses of computer graphics and interactive techniques and their potential risks and abuses.
a. Entertainment, business, and scientific applications: e.g., visual effects, generative imagery,
computer vision, machine learning, user interfaces, video editing, games and game engines,
computer-aided design and manufacturing, data visualization, and virtual/augmented/mixed
reality
b. Intellectual property, deep fakes, facial recognition, privacy (See also: SEP-DEIA, SEP-Privacy,
SEP-IP, SEP-Professional-Ethics)
2. Graphic output
a. Displays (e.g., LCD)
b. Printers
c. Analog film
d. Concepts
i. Resolution (e.g., pixels, dots)
ii. Aspect ratio
iii. Frame rate
3. Human vision system
a. Tristimulus reception (RGB)
b. Eye as a camera (projection)
c. Persistence of vision (frame rate, motion blur)
d. Contrast (detection, Mach banding, dithering/aliasing)
e. Non-linear response (dynamic range, tone mapping)
f. Binocular vision (stereo)
g. Accessibility (color deficiency, strobing, monocular vision, etc.) (See also: SEP-DEIA, HCI-User)
4. Standard image formats
a. Raster
i. Lossless (e.g., TIF)
ii. Lossy (e.g., JPG, GIF, etc.)
b. Vector (e.g., SVG, Adobe Illustrator)
5. Digitization of analog data
a. Rasterization
b. Resolution
c. Sampling and quantization
6. Color models: additive (RGB), subtractive (CMYK), and color perception (HSV)
7. Tradeoffs between storing image data and re-computing image data
8. Spatialization: coordinate systems, absolute and relative positioning
9. Animation as a sequence of still images
