Title: PDC-Communication: Communication

CS Core:
1. Media
a. Varieties: channels (message passing or I/O), shared memory, heterogeneous, data stores
b. Reliance on the availability and nature of underlying hardware, connectivity, and protocols;
language support, emulation (See also: AR-IO)
2. Channels
a. Explicit (usually named) party-to-party communication media
b. APIs: Sockets, architectural, language-based, and toolkit constructs, such as Message
Passing Interface (MPI), and layered constructs such as Remote Procedure Call (RPC) (See
also: NC-Fundamentals)
c. I/O channel APIs
3. Memory
220
a. Shared memory architectures in which parties directly communicate only with memory at
given addresses, with extensions to heterogeneous memory supporting multiple memory
stores with explicit data transfer across them; for example, GPU local and shared memory,
Direct Memory Access (DMA)
b. Memory hierarchies: Multiple layers of sharing domains, scopes, and caches; locality:
latency, false-sharing
c. Consistency properties: Bitwise atomicity limits, coherence, local ordering
4. Data Stores
a. Cooperatively maintained data structures implementing maps and related ADTs
b. Varieties: Owned, shared, sharded, replicated, immutable, versioned
