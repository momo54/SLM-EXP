Title: SF-Overview: Overview of Computer Systems

CS Core:
1. Basic building blocks and components of a computer (gates, flip-flops, registers, interconnections;
datapath + control + memory)
2. Hardware as a computational paradigm: Fundamental logic building blocks; Logic expressions,
minimization, sum of product forms (See also: AR-Logic)
3. Programming abstractions, interfaces, use of libraries (See also: PDC-Programs)
4. Distinction and interaction between application and OS services, remote procedure call (See also:
OS-Purpose)
5. Basic concept of pipelining, overlapped processing stages (See also: AR-Organization)
6. Basic concept of scaling: performance vs problem size
