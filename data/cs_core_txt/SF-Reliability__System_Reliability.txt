Title: SF-Reliability: System Reliability

CS Core:
1. Distinction between bugs, faults, and failures (See also: PDC-Coordination, SE-Reliability)
2. Reliability vs availability
3. Reliability through redundancy
a. check and retry (See also: OS-Faults, NC-Reliability)
b. redundant encoding (error correction codes, CRC, FEC, RAID) (See also: AR-Memory, NC-
Reliability, DM-Distributed)
c. duplication/mirroring/replicas (See also: DM-Distributed)
