Title: FPL-Systems: Systems Execution and Memory Model

CS Core:
1. Explain how a core language construct, such as data abstractions and control abstractions, is
executed.
2. Explain how programming language implementations typically organize memory into global data,
text, heap, and stack sections and how features such as recursion and memory management map
to this memory model.
3. Explain why memory leaks and dangling pointer problems occur, and what can be done by a
programmer to avoid/fix them.
