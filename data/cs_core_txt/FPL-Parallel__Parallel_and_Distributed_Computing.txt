Title: FPL-Parallel: Parallel and Distributed Computing

CS Core:
1. Explain why programming languages do not guarantee sequential consistency in the presence of
data races and what programmers must do as a result.
2. Implement correct concurrent programs using multiple programming models, such as shared
memory, actors, futures, synchronization constructs, and data-parallelism primitives.
3. Use a message-passing model to analyze a communication protocol.
4. Use synchronization constructions such as monitor/synchronized methods in a simple program.
5. Modeling data dependency using simple programming constructs involving variables, read and
write.
6. Modeling control dependency using simple constructs such as selection and iteration.
