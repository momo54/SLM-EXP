Title: SF-Evaluation: Performance Evaluation

CS Core:
1. Performance figures of merit (See also: AR-Performance-Energy, PDC-Evaluation)
2. Workloads and representative benchmarks, and methods of collecting and analyzing performance
figures of merit (See also: AR-Performance-Energy, PDC-Evaluation)
3. CPI (Cycles per Instruction) equation as a tool for understanding tradeoffs in the design of
instruction sets, processor pipelines, and memory system organizations (See also: AR-
Performance-Energy, PDC-Evaluation)
4. Amdahlâ€™s Law: the part of the computation that cannot be sped up limits the effect of the parts that
can (See also: AR-Performance-Energy, PDC-Evaluation)
5. Order of magnitude analysis (Big O notation) (See also: AL-Complexity)
6. Analysis of slow and fast paths of a system (See also: AR-Organization)
7. Events on their effect on performance (e.g., instruction stalls, cache misses, page faults) (See also:
OS-Memory, AR-Organization)
