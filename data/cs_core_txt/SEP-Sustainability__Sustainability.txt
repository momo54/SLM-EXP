Title: SEP-Sustainability: Sustainability

CS Core:
1. Environmental, social, and cultural impacts of implementation decisions (e.g., sustainability goals,
algorithmic bias/outcomes, economic viability, and resource consumption)
2. Local/regional/global social and environmental impacts of computing systems and their use (e.g.,
carbon footprints, resource usage, e-waste) due to hardware (e.g., e-waste, data centers, rare
element and resource utilization, recycling) and software (e.g., cloud-based services, blockchain,
AI model training and use). This includes everyday use of hardware (cheap hardware replaced
frequently) and software (web-browsing, email, and other services with hidden/remote
computational demands).
3. Guidelines for sustainable design standards.
