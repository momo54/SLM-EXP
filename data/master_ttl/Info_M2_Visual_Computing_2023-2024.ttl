1- Human Computer Interaction: from intervention to UX to interaction to interfaces
2- Designing HCI: understanding situations and humans, modeling users and interaction, prototyping and iterating
3- Evaluating HCI: the many facets of HCI evaluation, from expert evaluations to experiments
4- Novel interactions: gesture, voice, touch, haptic-based interactions + AR/VR (see 3D computer graphics)
5- Project.
10 sessions of 2 hours each, 20 hours individual work, 20 hours project work Each student will make one or two presentation during the course.
Each project will imply 2 or 3 students designing an experimental setting and running à small evaluation to answer an HCI related question
